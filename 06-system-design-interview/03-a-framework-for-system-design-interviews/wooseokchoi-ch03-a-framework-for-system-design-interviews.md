# 4 step process

## Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope

- Do not jump right in to give a solution

- List of good quetions
  - What specific features to build?
  - Number of users
  - How fast the company scale up?
  - Tech stack
  - DAU
  - Data size

## Step 2 - Propose

- Initial blueprint for the design
- Draw diagrams
- Back of the envelope calculations
- Go through a few concrete use cases.(will help to frame the high level design and discover edge case)

* API endpoints and database schema design depends on the problem

## Step 3 - Design deep dive

- Identify and prioritize components in the architecture
- Dig into the details
  - ex) hash function design for url shortener, latency and on/off status for chat system

## Step 4 - Wrap up

- Discuss system bottlenecks and potential improvements
- Recap the design
- Error cases(server failure, network loss, etc)
- Operations(monitoring and logging)
- Scale up

### Dos
- Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct.
- Understand the requirements 
- There is neither the right answer nor the best answer. Understand the context.
- Communicate with your interview.
- Suggest multiple approaches if possible.
- Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each
component. Design the most critical components first.
- Bounce ideas off the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.
- Never give up.

### Don'ts
- Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions
- Don't jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.
- Don't go into too much details
- If you get stuck, ask for hints
- Don't think in silence.
- Ask for feedback early and often
